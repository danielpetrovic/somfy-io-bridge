// Phase 3 - this bridge acting as a real 2W controller (the role TaHoma
// plays), not just passively decoding another controller's traffic (that
// existing feature is IOHCCover::update_real_position(), unrelated to this
// file). See /root/.claude/plans/i-bought-a-lilygo-clever-planet.md's Phase
// 3 section and /config/.claude/io-2w-protocol.md (Findings 12-20) for the
// full research this is built on.
//
// REDESIGNED 2026-07-11 (Finding 20): every earlier attempt at this class
// assumed the MOTOR sends 0x28 DISCOVER spontaneously when its physical
// pairing button is pressed, with the box only ever replying
// (0x29/0x2C/0x32/...). That assumption is backwards, and is exactly why
// three independent real-hardware tests (Findings 12/15/17) found nothing.
// Confirmed by reading github.com/laberning/home_io_control - a mature,
// independently-tested ESPHome IO-Homecontrol component with confirmed
// real 2W pairing on the same SX1276 chip family - the CONTROLLER
// broadcasts 0x28 DISCOVER; a device already in pairing mode (physical
// button already pressed, same as before) just listens and answers with
// 0x29. The rest of bonding (0x31 KEY_INIT -> 0x3C CHALLENGE_REQ -> 0x32
// KEY_TRANSFER -> 0x33 KEY_CONFIRM) is also controller-initiated. See
// io-2w-protocol.md Finding 20 for the full byte-level writeup, including
// the real crypto bug this also exposed: per-command authentication (and
// the KEY_TRANSFER payload itself) needs a real per-installation
// `system_key`, not the fixed/public transfer_key this class used
// everywhere before.
//
// Everything downstream of bonding (the per-command challenge/response
// frame shape) was, and remains, thoroughly confirmed against many real
// TaHoma captures - only the bonding sequence itself and the crypto key
// used for ongoing authentication were wrong.
//
// REVISED AGAIN 2026-07-12 (Finding 22): Finding 20's redesign still got
// zero 0x29 replies on two different motors, both with real-hardware-
// confirmed open pairing windows (physical jog). Root cause found by
// reading home_io_control's proto_timing.h directly rather than just its
// higher-level docs: "Commands are sent on CH2; responses may arrive on
// any channel." Finding 20/21's implementation hopped the TRANSMIT channel
// for 0x28 across CH1/CH2/CH3 - backwards. The reference always transmits
// on CH2 and only hops the RECEIVE side while waiting for a reply (at a
// ~2.7ms ISR-driven cadence in their design - impractical to match exactly
// in this bridge's own architecture without touching the ISR layer, but a
// much faster loop()-driven RX hop than Finding 21's crude 5s-per-channel
// dwell is a real, tractable improvement). Also added Listen-Before-Talk
// (LBT) before every 2W transmission - proto_timing.h documents this as a
// real ETSI EN 300 220 compliance mechanism the reference implements and
// this bridge never had at all, and this session already captured direct
// evidence of real RF contention (TaHoma's own traffic landing mid-attempt
// during a bonding test).
